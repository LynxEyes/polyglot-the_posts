This is just a collection of the blog entries of my future blog.

The whole idea is to build my blog and document the process. After the first version is built, I'll start to implement this in multiple languages and frameworks.
My goal is to have something with which I can compare the different technologies and to show people that there is no such thing as the "TechX developer", only software developers.
