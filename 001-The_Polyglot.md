# The Polyglot - Mumblings of an Software Crafter

For years I've been calling myself a "Software Engineer" and I've tried to explain people why they shouldn't call themselves "Technology X Developer". A real developer doesn't bind himself to a single technology, he is able to tackle whatever technology is thrown at him.
Of course, we are human, we have preferences and we tend to keep with the things we like the most. As for myself, I've loved Ruby ever since I wrote my first line of Ruby code back in 2009.

The projects I've worked on over the years have exposed the best and the worst of ruby. Its amazing what you can do with so little code, its awesome the amount of books, tutorials, examples, blogs and other kind of material you can find on the internet, and the quality of the tools is not only astounding but has inspired many other communities into doing similar tools (rubygems, bundler, rvm/rbenv/chruby, etc..)
But ruby has a dark side as well. I've done a lot of data processing in ruby and ruby is clearly not the tool for that. Its slow, it limits you (MRI doesn't have threads), it consumes tons os memory just to run the most basic of ETLs. When you hit these problems you know that's a sign that you're forcing the wrong tool into your vision of the world.

I'm not saying ruby is bad, I'm just saying it is not appropriate for every single thing under the sun.

This is why I've decided to put my money where my mouth is. I've decided that I would build myself a (simple) blog with Ruby and then I'll re-implement it in all the technologies / frameworks that can capture my interest. With those re-implementations I'll fill the blog with entries that will capture my experience with those tools, how I've solved problems and what I end up thinking about those technologies.

I'm planning to re-implement my blog in:

* Java - SpringBoot
* Scala - Play
* Elixir - Phoenix
* Go - GIN
* Ruby - Hanami
* NodeJs - Express

And I'll eventually convert it to a SPA with:

* EmberJS
* Angular
* React

Stay tuned, its going to be a bumpy (and fun) ride!
